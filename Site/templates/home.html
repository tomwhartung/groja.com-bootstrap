            The abstract images on this site are called
              <span class="air-quotes">GROJAS</span> or
              <span class="air-quotes">Spiritual Portraits,</span>
              and each one represents a unique personality.</p>
          <p>
            GROJAs are Graphical Representations of Jungian Archetypes.</p>
          <p>
            Inspired by the work of Piet Mondrian, Carl Jung, Wassily Kandinsky,
              Isabel Myers-Briggs, and David Keirsey, the Groja Program &copy;
              creates portraits of individuals based on their score on
              the MBTI &reg; or a similar personality questionnaire.</p>

          I wrote the first version of this program in the 1980s,
           before the internet.
          So the original idea came totally from books.
          Of course much of that is online now, waiting for you to check it out!</p>

        <h3><span class="air-quotes">Can we talk?</span></h3>
        <p>
          I have always felt like I was on the
            <span class="air-quotes">wrong planet,</span> &mdash;
            do you by any chance know what I mean?
          </p>
          <p>
          If you know about these four-letter types, and are Introverted or
            iNtuitive or both (like me), maybe you know what I mean.
          Even my parents are my opposites in most ways, which can make things difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
          Either you know what I'm talking about, or you don't.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like everyone else, I have my own ideas and perceptions.
          I also have my own questionnaire, which wil be back online soon,
            and ultimately this is my own thing.
          And this is the site where I share it with you.</p>
        <p>
          All of this is based on Carl Jung's theories and Wassily Kandidnsky's
            observations, so there is a historical precedent.
          My wish is to honor, carry on, and build on the work of my predecessors without
            stepping on any toes, legal or otherwise.</p>
