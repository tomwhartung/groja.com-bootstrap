      These books gave me the idea for these Spiritual Portraits, and
        helped me formulate the logic underlying the Groja &copy; Program.
      The sites make much of this information available quickly and easily to
        those interested in learning more.</p>

        Note however that he originally wrote it in German and
		    the translation can be a little difficult to read.
        Someone new to this (and less interested in the theory) may want to
		    pick up a copy of Isabel Briggs Myers or David Keirsey's books first.</dd>

        <em>The New Art, the New Life, the Collected Works of Piet Mondrian</em>,
        edited and translated by Harry Holtzman and Martin S. James, 1986.</dt>
      <dd>
        Like Jung's, Mondrian's writings can be difficult to read sometimes, but
         it is well worth the effort it takes to read them.
        Importantly, he believed strongly that the fact that because opposites in form and color
         can exist in harmony on a canvas, people who manifest opposites in personality
         can exist in harmony in our society.

        <em>Gifts Differing</em> by Isabel Briggs Myers and Peter Myers, 1980.</dt>
      <dd>
        This book by the originator of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) makes
         Jung's theories easier to understand &mdash; and even practical in
         our day-to-day lifes.</dd>

        <em>Concerning the Spiritual in Art</em> by Wassily Kandinsky, 1912.</dt>
      <dd>
        In this book Kandinsky examines society as a whole in the context of history, and
         teaches us to look past the surface of art and examine how works affect us emotionally.
        To try to summarize this enlightening book in a single sentence is to do it a great disservice.
        Fortunately for us it's now available at archive.org for free (see the link below).

      <dt>
        <em>Point and Line to Plane</em> by Wassily Kandinsky, 1926.</dt>
      <dd>
        This wonderful book makes a science out of art, breaking down the geometric plane of
         the artist's into its essential elements: points, lines, and planes.
        Fortunately for us it's now available at archive.org for free (see the link below).

      <dt>
        <em>Please Understand Me</em> by David Keirsey and Marilyn Bates, 1984.</dt>
      <dd>
        This book builds on Jung's and Myers' work.
        He groups the sixteen types into four temperaments, which makes it a lot
         easier to see these qualities at work in the people we interact with on a daily basis.
        It is also a good one to have because it starts off with a short yet accurate
         quiz that can help you determine your four-letter type fairly quickly.</dd>
      <dt>
        <em>Please Understand Me II</em> by David Keirsey and Marilyn Bates, 1998.</dt>
      <dd>
        This updated edition contains the same quiz as the original, but delves more deeply into
         the descriptions of the four temperaments and how they interact with each other.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
       You can of course find a copy of any of these at
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com" title="Amazon.com home page" target="_blank">Amazon.com</a>,
        and probably find most or perhaps even all of them at your local public library.

		    three in English and one in Spanish!</p>
      <p>
        The first one got pretty beat up so I bought a replacement.
		  When he came out with the second edition I of course had to buy that.
		  Then one day I saw the Spanish version for sale and couldn't
			 resist picking that up.</p>
      <p>
        It should go without saying that I recommend recommend it highly!</p>
