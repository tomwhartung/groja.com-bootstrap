    <h1>About Spiritual Portraits</h1>
    <p>
      Hello, my name is Tom Hartung, and all my life I have tried to see
       past the surface and into the essence and substance of people.</p>
    <p>
      I'd like to share with you a bit of what I've learned over the years and,
       in the process, help you see past the surface, too.
      And I'd like to do this by creating your Spiritual Portrait &mdash;
       your GROJA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each image is a unique representation of a unique personality,
        and I want to help you and everyone else see the unique inner beauty
        that each of us possesses.</p>
    <p>

    <h2>Growing up Ain't for Sissies</h2>
    <p>
      I believe growing up is difficult for all of us, and I was certainly no exception.
      Conforming to society's, parents', and our peers' expectations is easier for some
       than it is for others.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took awhile for me to realize that some of the things that were natural and easy for
       others to do were unnatural and difficult for me.
      So I learned early on to respect others' differences, both superficial and otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I grew into adulthood, I learned about the source of many of the invisible,
       intangible differences that can pose such a challenge for some of us.
      For this I give thanks to the lesssons learned from those mentioned on the
       <a href="booksandsites" title="Link to the Books and Sites page on this site">
          books and sites page</a>,

    <h2>A Programmer Walks Into an Art History Class...</h2>
    <p>
      One day in a History of Modern Painting (Art History) class at
       Virginia Commonwealth University
       (<a href="http://www.vcu.edu/" title="VCU.edu home page"
           target="_blank">VCU</a>)
       the teacher introduced us to Piet Mondrian.
      She said that what he did might look easy, but if you try to
       do it yourself, you will find it is very difficult.</p>
    <p>
      The teacher tried to impress upon us how difficult it is to produce
       something like this.
      But as someone who was extremely interested in and excited about
       Artificial Intelligence at the time, I couldn't stop the thought that
       <span class="air-quotes">maybe a computer could do that!</span>
       from jumping into my head.</p>
    <p>
      By this time I also had some interest in psychology &mdash; and
        had discovered Carl Jung's, Isabel Briggs Myers', and DavidKeirsey's work.
    <p>
      Trying to think of how to write a program to <span class="air-quotes">do that</span>
       was definitely a challenge.</p>
    <p>
      Reading Mondrian's writings increased my admiration for the man.
      It is amazing &mdash; but not entirely surprising &mdash; to learn that he lived
       much of his life in poverty.</p>

    <h3>Manifesto: A Statement of Purpose</h3>
    <p>
     Does this seem complicated?</p>
    <p>
     Is it at all obvious that this idea's roots are in abstract paintings done close to a hundred years ago?
     I hope so, but if not, let's clear something up right now.</p>
    <p>
     At its core, the purpose of this idea is two-fold:</p>
    <ul class="standalone">
     <li>
      To enable us to see the invisible</li>
     <li>
      To promote harmony between opposites</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     See, it's really not that complicated after all!</p>

        <h2>Versions</h2>
        <p>
         Following is a list of the versions of the Groja Program &copy; I have written:</p>
        <dl class="standalone">
          <dt>
            <em>1989 </em>Grad School IBM 8086 PC version</dt>
          <dd>
            Written in LISP for my Interdisciplinary Masters Degree.
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <em>2001 </em>Raw PHP 4 version</dt>
          <dd>
            Not Object Oriented and a hellish interface, but it drew images (until the register globals thing).
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <em>2005 </em>PHP Nuke version</dt>
          <dd>
            The best thing I can say about PHP Nuke is, it made me willing to try out Joomla, WordPress, and Drupal.
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <em>2008 </em>Joomla 1.x version</dt>
          <dd>
            An attempt to create a social, web 2.0, rolling-blog type of site.
            I am not the type to monitor or even promote this type of site.
            Now the software but even the basic goals and paradigm of the site is totally obsolete.
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <em>20?? </em>Next version?!?</dt>
          <dd>
            Now that there are so many new technologies, and they are all changing so fast,
             it is difficult to prioritize on how to build on this idea.
            That is why I am making this personal: talking to users and creating individualized and personal portraits.
            This will fuel how I decide to continue with this work.
