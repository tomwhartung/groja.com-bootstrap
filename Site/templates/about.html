            <p>
              Hello, my name is Tom Hartung and I want to help you see past the surface.</p>
            <p>
              And I'd like to do this by creating
              your Spiritual Portrait &mdash; your GROJA &copy;
              (<span class="air-quotes">
                  Graphical Representation of Jungian Archetypes.</span>)
            </p>
            <p>
              Each image is a unique representation of a unique personality.</p>
            <p>
              To find out how you can get your personalized GROJA,

            <h3>One Day in Art History Class...</h3>
            <p>
              One day in a History of Modern Painting (Art History) class at
              Virginia Commonwealth University
              (<a href="http://www.vcu.edu/" title="VCU.edu home page"

              the teacher introduced us to Piet Mondrian.
              She said that what he did might look easy, but if you try to
              do it yourself, you will find it is very difficult.</p>
            <p>
              As someone who was interested in Artificial Intelligence at the time,
              the thought <span class="air-quotes">maybe a computer could do that!</span>
              jumped into my head.</p>
            <p>
              The teacher tried to impress upon us how difficult it is to produce
              something like this.</p>
            <p>
              As someone who grew up with a lot of negativity, I always had some interest in
              psychology &mdash; in learning why we think the things we do.
              Early on I discovered Myers-Briggs' and Keirsey's work, and
              eventually found time to read Carl Jung's original work.
            <p>
              Trying to think of how to write a program to <span class="air-quotes">do that</span>
              was definitely a challenge.</p>
            <p>
              Reading Mondrian's writings increased my admiration for the man
              It is amazing &mdash; but not entirely surprising &mdash; to learn that he lived
              much of his life in poverty.</p>

              <h3>Manifesto: A Statement of Purpose</h3>
              <p>
                Does this seem complicated?</p>
              <p>
                Is it at all obvious that this idea's roots are in abstract paintings done close to a hundred years ago?
                I hope so, but if not, let's clear something up right now.</p>
              <p>
                At its core, the purpose of this idea is two-fold:</p>
              <ul class="standalone">
                <li>
                  To enable us to see the invisible</li>
                <li>
                  To promote harmony between opposites</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                See, it's really not that complicated after all!</p>

            <h3>Versions</h3>
            <p>
              Following is a list of the versions of the Groja Program &copy; I have written:</p>
            <dl class="standalone">
              <dt>
                <em>1989 </em>Grad School IBM 8086 PC version</dt>
              <dd>
                Written in LISP for my Interdisciplinary Masters Degree.
                </dd>
              <dt>
                <em>2001 </em>Raw PHP 4 version</dt>
              <dd>
                Not Object Oriented and a hellish interface, but it drew images (until the register globals thing).
                </dd>
              <dt>
                <em>2005 </em>PHP Nuke version</dt>
              <dd>
                The best thing I can say about PHP Nuke is, it made me willing to try out Joomla, WordPress, and Drupal.
                </dd>
              <dt>
                <em>2008 </em>Joomla 1.x version</dt>
              <dd>
                An attempt to create a social, web 2.0, rolling-blog type of site.
                I am not the type to monitor or even promote this type of site.
                Now the software but even the basic goals and paradigm of the site is totally obsolete.
                </dd>
              <dt>
                <em>20?? </em>Next version?!?</dt>
              <dd>
                Now that there are so many new technologies, and they are all changing so fast,
                it is difficult to prioritize on how to build on this idea.
                That is why I am making this personal: talking to users and creating individualized and personal portraits.
                This will fuel how I decide to continue with this work.
