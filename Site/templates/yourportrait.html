    <h3>Handmade Portraits</h3>
    <p>
      Although a large part of this process is automated by the
        Groja Program &copy;, producing high-quality, unique and
        personalized portraits takes time.
      Add to that the possibility that I will want to
        ensure customers understand and appreciate its significance
        means that each image requires a personal touch.</p>
    <p>
      Also, the program contains many options, such as different resolutions and
      orientations (portrait vs. landscape) and even different compositions.
      At this time, these options not currently demonstrated in the
      <a href="http://seeourminds.com/galleries/gallery.html"
         title="Link to the galleries page on seeourminds.com" target="_blank">
        galleries</a>.
      If you are willing to work with me a bit, I can help you determine
        what sort of image you like the most and
        ensure it is within your price range before starting on it!</p>

        <h3>Factors Affecting the Cost</h3>
        <p>
          Following is a list of some of the factors affecting the cost of
            your personalized Spiritual Portrait:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Which version of the quiz you take
            </li>
          <li>
            How much time I have to spend explaining the process to you
            </li>
          <li>
            How much time I spend explaining the underlying theory, and
              its significance in our day-to-day lives, to you
            </li>
          <li>Whether you want any special customizations, such as:
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>Resolution
                </li>
              <li>Aspect ratio
                </li>
              <li>An experimental composition
                </li>
              <li>
                </li>
            </ul>
          <li>x
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I have absolutely no expectation that creating these will make me fabulously rich,
          and I am certainly not looking to take advantage of anyone here.
          </p>
        <p>
          However, I have put a lot of time &mdash; years, in fact &mdash; into coming up with this idea,
          writing the
          <a href="../about/#versions" title="Link to the list of versions on the 'About' page">
            various versions</a>
          of the program, building and managing this site and its predecessors and
          ultimately the (highly unnatural &mdash; for me, anyway) effort required to
          let people know that this service is available.</p>
        <p>
          And of course after all that, there is the time spent creating a personalized image and
          making sure it meets your satisfaction.
          </p>
        <p>
          So I hope that if you are interested, you will
          <a href="conversion/groja" target="_blank"
             title="Link to contact us page.">
            contact us</a>
          and give us the opportunity to create a beautiful, unique, and
          highly personal Spiritual Portrait &mdash; one that you can fully appreciate and enjoy now and for years to come!
