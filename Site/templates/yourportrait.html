            <h3>Handmade Portraits</h3>
            <p>
              Due to a large variety of reasons, the biggest one being I want total control over the quality of these images,
              I have decided to create all Spiritual Portraits by hand.</p>
            <p>
              Although a large part of this process is automated by the Groja Program &copy;,
              producing high-quality, unique and personalized portraits, and
              ensuring you understand its significance and meaning requires a personal touch.</p>
            <p>
              Finally, the program contains many options, such as different resolutions and
              orientations (portrait vs. landscape) not currently demonstrated in the
              <a href="../galleries/gallery.html" title="Link to the galleries page">
                galleries</a>.
              I can help you decide what sort of image pleases you and
              ensure it is within your price range before starting on it!</p>

            <h3>Factors Affecting the Cost</h3>
            <p>
              Following is a list of factors affecting the cost of your personalized Spiritual Portrait:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Which version of the quiz you take
                </li>
              <li>
                How much time I have to spend explaining the process to you
                </li>
              <li>
                How much time I spend explaining the underlying theory, and its significance in our day-to-day lives, to you
                </li>
              <li>x
                </li>
              <li>x
                </li>
              <li>x
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              I have absolutely no expectation that creating these will make me fabulously rich,
              and I am certainly not looking to take advantage of anyone here.
              </p>
            <p>
              However, I have put a lot of time &mdash; years, in fact &mdash; into coming up with this idea,
              writing the
              <a href="../about/#versions" title="Link to the list of versions on the 'About' page">
                various versions</a>
              of the program, building and managing this site and its predecessors and
              ultimately the (highly unnatural &mdash; for me, anyway) effort required to
              let people know that this service is available.</p>
            <p>
              And of course after all that, there is the time spent creating a personalized image and
              making sure it meets your satisfaction.
              </p>
            <p>
              So I hope that if you are interested, you will

              and give me the opportunity to create a beautiful, unique, and
              highly personal Spiritual Portrait &mdash; one that you can fully appreciate and enjoy now and for years to come!
