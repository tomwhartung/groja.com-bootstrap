## Html5BoilerPlate - Css File Basics

* bootstrap*.map files - ok to ignore
* bootstrap*.css files - DO NOT EDIT
* main.css - not sure where these styles came from, but the comments look like ones I would make (*)
* groja.css - new file - PUT NEW STYLES HERE

(*) Searched through the various directories in the always_learning_python repo for versions of this file.
When getting started we tried out various options on the html5boilerplate download site.
Looking at the history, it appears that some of those options would populate this file (main.css).
However, the comments in the file look like the sort of comments I like to make.
For example, "make everything exactly perfect." ;-)
So....
Therefore we are putting "new" (post-flask) customizations in a new file, main-customizations.css .
