    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
      Groja: Graphical Representations of Jungian Archetypes.</p>
    <p>
      I am inspired by Myers-Briggs' and Keirsey's work, and cannot praise them enough!
      But I have my own quiz, ideas and perceptions, and ultimately this is my own thing.
      All of this is based on Carl Jung's theories so naturally similarities abound.</p>

    <h3>Manifesto: A Statement of Purpose</h3>
    <p>
      Does this seem complicated?
      I hope not, but if it does, let's clear something up right now.</p>
    <p>
      The purpose of this site is two-fold:</p>
    <ul class="standalone">
      <li>
        To enable us to see the invisible</li>
      <li>
        To promote harmony between opposites</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      See, it's really not that complicated after all!</p>

    <h3>Versions</h3>
    <p>
      List of versions:</p>
    <dl class="standalone">
      <dt>
        Grad School IBM 8086 PC version</dt>
      <dd>
        Written in LISP for my Interdisciplinary Masters Degree.
        </dd>
      <dt>
        Raw PHP 4 version</dt>
      <dd>
        Not Object Oriented and a hellish interface, but it drew images (until the register globals thing).
        </dd>
      <dt>
        PHP Nuke version</dt>
      <dd>
        The best thing I can say about PHP Nuke is, it made me willing to try out Joomla, WordPress, and Drupal.
        </dd>
      <dt>
        Joomla 1.x version</dt>
      <dd>
        An attempt to create a social, web 2.0, rolling-blog type of site.
        I am not the type to monitor or even promote this type of site.
        Now the software but even the basic goals and paradigm of the site is totally obsolete.
        </dd>
      <dt>
        Next version?!?</dt>
      <dd>
        Now that there are so many new technologies, and they are all changing so fast,
        it is difficult to prioritize on how to build on this idea.
        That is why I am making this personal: talking to users and creating individualized and personal portraits.
        This will fuel how I decide to continue with this work.
