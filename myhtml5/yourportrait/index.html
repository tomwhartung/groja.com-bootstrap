    <h3>Your Portrait</h3>
    <p>
      Due to a large variety of reasons, the biggest one being I want total control over the quality of these images,
      I have decided to create all Spiritual Portraits by hand.</p>
    <p>
      Although a large part of this process is automated by the Groja Program &copy;,
      producing high-quality, unique and personalized portraits, and
      ensuring you understand its significance and meaning requires a personal touch.</p>
    <p>
      Finally, the program contains many options, such as different resolutions and
      orientations (portrait vs. landscape) not currently demonstrated in the
      <a href="../galleries/gallery.html" title="Link to the galleries page">
        galleries</a>.
      I can help you decide what sort of image pleases you and
      ensure it is within your price range before starting on it!</p>

    <h3>How Much?</h3>
    <p>
      The cost of each Spiritual Portrait ranges from $0 to $500 and
      depends on how much <span class="air-quotes">work</span> I have to put into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you know your four-letter type, the corresponding
      <a href="../galleries/gallery.html?gallery=generics" title="Link to the generic portraits' galleries page">
        generic portrait</a>
      is an image of your personality.
      So feel free to download that and <span class="air-quotes">call it a day!</span>
