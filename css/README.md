## CSS shared by all versions

This file contains styles that have been copied from a specific version
so that we can make them available to all of the versions.

This means that, once we decide on a version to use, we will want to
delete the styles if they are already defined in the version we pick.

Of course, that means we need to keep track of which version we copy
the styles from, so that once we make the decision, we can easily
remove the redundancy as necessary.

Hope that makes sense.

### From the initializr-responsive version

From css/main.css in the initializr-responsive version, for the nav bar:

Copy of all the styles used for nav elements and some/most used for title class.

* 87-121 ("MOBILE: Menu") - a style for the title and the rest are for nav elements
* 145-152 ("ALL: IE Fixes") -for the title on IE7
* 171-208 ("Media Queries") - all of "min-width: 480 px" styles are for nav elements
* 223-234 ("WIDE: Menu") - inside a media query


### From the initializr-responsive version: TBD

From the initializr-bootstrap version, for the collapsible nav bar:
Ok, maybe we just need bootstrap?
